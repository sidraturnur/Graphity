# About Graphity
Graphity is a simple graph tool to create and simulate graph using an graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaSwing. Using this graph tool users can also apply the core graph algorithms to the created graph.
### Creating a graph
to create a graph,click on the GUI panel to add nodes and click two nodes to create a weighted (user may input the weight in the "Weight" textfield) edge between them.
Click on a node to select it and click the "Remove node" option to remove the selected node. 
to remove an edge choose the option "Remove edge" and select the two nodes that you want to remove the edge between.
### Performing algorithms
After creating the desired graph one can perform any of the graph algorithms provided. In case of BFS,DFS, Prim's and Dijkstra, user must enter a start node. The project also presents a basic visualization of the chosen algorithm by highlighting the paths the algorithm takes when it is performed.
